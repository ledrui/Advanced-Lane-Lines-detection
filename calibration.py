    This class allows for the calibration of camera images. When intitialised, it takes in a list of images, as well as the size of the chessboard.
    It then analyses each image in turn, and detects the chessboards on all these images. Once all the chessboard points have been found,
    it creates a camera and distortion matrix, allowing for this matrix to be applied to any image from the same camera by using CameraCalibration.undistort()
